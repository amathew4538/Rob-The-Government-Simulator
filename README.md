# Rob-The-Government-Simulator
## This is Rob The Government Simulator
Rob The Government is an open-source game in which the code, models, textures, animations, etc. you, the reader, make will be added to the game in Unreal Engine and playable for free in itch.io.

# Rules
SFW Content only (I'm not getting in trouble for that bro)

No deleting other's code for no reason (basically, don't be a stupid, annoying troll)

Only share useful info with others (don't annoy people)

No stealing any assets that have been created (it's Rob The Government Sim, not Rob The Hard-Working Contributors Sim.)

Please only write code in C++ (It's the native language so it makes my life easier.)

### ***All violators will be banned (or warned if you use the wrong code).***
